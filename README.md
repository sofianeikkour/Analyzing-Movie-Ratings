# Analyzing-Movie-Ratings

#### **Context:**  
This project is about web scraping in which we'll perform practical web data extraction in order to analyze movie ratings. The web page we'll use is [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/). IMDB is the world's most popular source for movie, TV, and celebrity content.  

#### **Objective:** 
The goal is to extract data from the top 30 movies between [March and July 2020](http://dataquestio.github.io/web-scraping-pages/IMDb-DQgp.html). We can extract various details, including a movie's title, description actors, director, genre, runtime, and ratings. Then, we'll investigate the correlation between ratings and user votes.
